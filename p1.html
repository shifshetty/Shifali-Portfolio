							<p>The objective of this project is to bring to light the poor access to safe drinking water (a basic human right) around the world. It aims to educate people on the dire conditions in most regions of the world when it comes to getting a clean glass of water. The intended audience is the general public (primarily adults) who are interested and concerned about the worlds environmental conditions.
                                As part of this project I studied the below public public visualisation that showed the quality of drinking water measured in EQI around the world.<br/>
                                
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Quality-of-Drinking-Water.png" alt="" /></span>

                                The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

                                    <li>The visualisation has very poor readability. It is very hard to find the information of a particular country you are looking for as there is no specific reasoning (such as geographic location, alphabetical order etc) behind the placement of each bubble apart from trying to make the graph look like a water droplet. Also a lot of information is crammed in places so it is hard to follow which country a bubble belongs to. Try looking for say Japan, It will take you a while to find it!</li>

                                    <li>The size of the bubbles in the visualisation are proportional to the EPI score. This highlights the countries with high quality drinking water and subdues the countries with low quality water. This leads to a disproportionate representation of countries even though the information is equally important.</li>

                                    <li>The visualisation does not tell us how a country compares with respect to other countries so it is hard to answer the question Where is the Worlds Most Dangerous Drinking Water?. </li><br/>
                                
                                I then created a new visualisation that addressed these concerns and represented the data well.<br/>
